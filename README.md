# DSA & SQL Practice Repository
### Finance Consultant → Data Engineer | Feb 2025 – July 2025

This repo tracks my daily DSA and SQL practice as I transition from SAP Finance Consulting into Data Engineering.

**Background:** 3 years SAP Finance Consulting + ECC to S/4HANA migration + 6 month product company internship.  
**Target:** Data Engineer (Finance) at a funded fintech startup by July 2025.

## Timeline

| Phase | Dates | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Phase 1A | Feb 19 – Mar 1 | DSA + SQL basics. Online IDE, parents' place. |
| Phase 1B | Mar 2 – Mar 17 | DSA continues. SQL intermediate. Local setup. |
| Phase 2 | Mar 18 – Apr 10 | Maintenance only during international go-live trip. |
| Phase 3 | Apr 11 – July | DSA depth + SQL advanced + Interview simulation. |

---

## Rules

- Max **25-30 minutes** on a problem before checking the approach. No rabbit holes.
- Understand the pattern, then **code it without looking**. Move on.
- **20 minutes on a bad day** is still forward momentum. Never skip entirely.
- DSA and SQL both get daily time. They are not optional for each other.
